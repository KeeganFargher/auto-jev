# Welcome to Colyseus!

This project was bootstrapped with [⚔️ `create-colyseus-app`](https://github.com/colyseus/create-colyseus-app/)
and then split apart: this package is **server-only**. The browser client
lives in [`apps/client`](../client), a separate Vite project, and code both
sides need lives in [`packages/shared`](../../packages/shared).

[Documentation](https://docs.colyseus.io/)

## :crossed_swords: Usage

```
pnpm --filter @jev-game/server start
```

Then open http://localhost:2567/playground for the playground, or /monitor for
the monitor. `/` itself is a 404 — there is no client to serve from here.

## Structure

- `src/index.ts`: entry point — leave it alone if you plan to deploy to Colyseus Cloud
- `src/app.config.ts`: server configuration — rooms, HTTP routes, express middleware
- `src/rooms/MyRoom.ts`: your room handler
- `src/rooms/schema/MyRoomState.ts`: the state synchronized to every client in the room
- `test/MyRoom.test.ts`: boots the real server and connects a real client
- `loadtest/example.ts`: scriptable client for `npm run loadtest`
- `ecosystem.config.cjs`: pm2 configuration, used when deploying to Colyseus Cloud

## Scripts

- `npm start` / `npm run dev`: run the server in watch mode (`tsx watch src/index.ts`)
- `npm test`: run the mocha test suite
- `npm run build`: typecheck, then bundle to `build/index.js` with esbuild
- `npm run loadtest`: connect N simulated clients with [`@colyseus/loadtest`](https://github.com/colyseus/colyseus-loadtest/)

## What's included

### Monorepo layout

This follows `create-colyseus-app --layout monorepo`: a plain `tsx`-run
backend with no Vite involved, the frontend importing the backend's _types_
(not its code) as a `workspace:*` devDependency. `packages/shared` is added
on top for the one thing the vanilla layout doesn't need: real code (not
just types) shared by both sides — see "Fixed tick + client prediction".

### Production build

`packages/shared` exports raw TypeScript source with no build step of its
own, so plain `tsc` can't produce a deployable server: it leaves
`import "@jev-game/shared"` as a bare specifier that `node` can't resolve.
`npm run build` bundles `src/index.ts` with esbuild instead, external-ing
every real npm dependency (`--external:colyseus --external:@colyseus/*
--external:express`) so only `@jev-game/shared` gets inlined. `tsc --noEmit`
runs first for type errors; esbuild itself doesn't type-check.

Express runs in this same process, so the playground lives at `/playground`
next to `/monitor`.

### Fixed tick + client prediction

The room advances on `setFixedTimestep()`: a framework-owned accumulator runs
`step()` a whole number of times per frame, each advancing exactly `1/TICK_RATE`
seconds. A constant `dt` is what makes the client able to replay the same steps
— with `setTimestep()`'s measured delta it could not.

`defineInput(MoveInput, …)` gives each client a server-side input buffer.
`sanitize` clamps every field as it arrives, because nothing off the wire is
trustworthy. The input schema is deliberately flat and carries no `seq`, no `dt`
and no timestamp: the engine's own counter is the sequence, one input advances
exactly one step, and the SDK stamps lag-comp timing on the wire envelope.

`packages/shared/src/movement.ts` holds the one function both sides run. It is
typed structurally so the same code steps a server Schema instance and the
client reconciler's plain predicted copy, and it is pure — no clocks, no
randomness, no reads outside its arguments. Keep it that way, or prediction
and server will disagree. Both `apps/server` and `apps/client` depend on it as
`@jev-game/shared` (`workspace:*`).

For the client-side half of this contract — the reconciler that replays
`stepEntity` on rollback — see `apps/client` and the netcode guide:

- https://docs.colyseus.io/netcode/client-prediction

### Lobby room

A `LobbyRoom` is registered as `lobby`, and the sample room is chained with
`.enableRealtimeListing()` so the lobby receives create/update/dispose events for
it. Clients join the lobby to render a live room browser:

```ts
const lobby = await client.joinOrCreate("lobby");
lobby.onMessage("rooms", (rooms) => {
  /* full list on join */
});
lobby.onMessage("+", ([roomId, room]) => {
  /* added or updated */
});
lobby.onMessage("-", (roomId) => {
  /* removed */
});
```

### Reconnection

`MyRoom.onDrop()` holds a dropped client's seat for 30 seconds via
`allowReconnection()`. The SDK retries automatically with exponential backoff;
`onReconnect()` fires if it gets back in time, `onLeave()` if it does not.
